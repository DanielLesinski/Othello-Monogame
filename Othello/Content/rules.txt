The game starts the player with the black disc.
In the game, we make moves that can be used to obtain our opponent's discs.
Other types of moves are not allowed. To capture the opponent's disks,
we need to surround him with our own disks in a straight line in any direction.
All the pieces we have surrounded are changed to our color.
Players take turns making moves. If a player has no legal move, he loses his turn.
The game ends when the entire board is filled or no player can make any allowed move.
The player who occupied more squares on the board wins.

Control:
-Use LMB to make a move
